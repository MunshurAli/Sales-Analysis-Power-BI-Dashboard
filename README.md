Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to analyze sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior across different product categories,
customer segments, and time periods. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key business metrics and trends, allowing for  strategic decision-making.

📈 Key Insights Uncovered:

* Total Profit: $10.46M, with an average profit per customer of $600.47
* Total Revenue: $24.91M, driven by 84.17K units sold
* Identified fluctuations in monthly sales, with a 13% drop in orders compared to the previous month
* The “Road Bikes” and “Mountain Bikes” categories emerged as the top performers in terms of profit
* Sales trends were analyzed by region, gender, and occupation, offering actionable demographic insights
* Tracked return rates (2.17%) and highlighted categories with high return volumes for potential optimization
